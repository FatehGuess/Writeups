# Challnge description

**| Never gonna give you up.
    Never gonna let you down.
    Never gonna run around and desert you.
    Never gonna make you cry.
    Never gonna say goodbye.
    Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you.
    Rick Astley is singing.. But silently !**

## Soluton

By listening to the given song, I noticed that the file is somehow corrupted, there is a noise in the song which is not in the original one. I tried to extract the metadata from the file but it was passphrase protected. The next thing to do is use one of these audio sowtares to see the spectrogram of the song,
Bingo it's there !!
