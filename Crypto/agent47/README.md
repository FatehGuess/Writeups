# Challenge description 

**We intercepted this discussion between agent47 and his boss.
Can you find out what they are talking about?**

**Hint: there isn't onlyy rot13** 

## Solution 

This is an easy challenge, and the decription + the hint says it all. It must be a rot47 ciphertext.
and that's it, we obtain a base64 code, decode it and the flag is:

shellmates{r0t47_15_Ju5T_L1k3_r0t13}
